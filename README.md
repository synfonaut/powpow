## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where is my private key?

Your private key is generated on a .bit file in your local directory. If you put funds on it, please back it up.

### How do I connect to a remote node?

Use the environment variables below to change the node information

    RPC_HOST=127.0.0.1 RPC_USER=root RPC_PASS=bitcoin PEER_HOST=127.0.0.1 powpow fire 1Jpgfg9fFNKVVGxYgUhuKhdbxTSKBUnVf4

### How do I change the number of transactions I'm sending?

Specify the number after the address

    powpow fire 1Jpgfg9fFNKVVGxYgUhuKhdbxTSKBUnVf4 20

### How do I change the amount of satoshis I'm sending?

Specify the --satoshis flag

    powpow fire --satoshis 600 1Jpgfg9fFNKVVGxYgUhuKhdbxTSKBUnVf4

### Why are my transactions getting rejected?

Probably because the fee is too low, try sending a lower satoshi amount.

*Disclamer: This is new and experimental code, don't send a lot of money without testing first*

## TODO

- UTXO calculation could be much better, should calculate optimal size
- Add RPC_PORT env variable
- P2P
